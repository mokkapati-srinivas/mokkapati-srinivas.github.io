Real-time American Sign Language (ASL) recognition system that can classify hand gestures with millisecond-level latency using Convolutional Neural Networks. The system uses CNN architecture optimized for hand gesture classification and is trained on extensive dataset of ASL signs. This system helps bridge communication gaps for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by providing real-time translation of sign language gestures.
